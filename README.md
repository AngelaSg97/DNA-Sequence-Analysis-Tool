# DNA-Sequence-Analysis-Tool
tool was developed for DNA sequence analysis. It lets users input, load, or randomly generate sequences, and perform alignments. The program analyzes the highest-scoring sequences in detail, generating dot plots and scoring matrices. The menu-driven system computes matches, mismatches, and gaps in a continuous, user-controlled session.
